# XBIM - the eXtensible Building Information Modelling (BIM) Toolkit
<br>XBIM - 可扩展建筑信息模型（BIM）工具包

## What is it?

The xBIM Tookit (eXtensible Building Information Modelling) is an open-source, software development BIM toolkit that 
supports the BuildingSmart Data Model (aka the [Industry Foundation Classes IFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes)).

xBIM allows developers to read, create and view [Building Information (BIM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) Models in the IFC format. 
There is full support for geometric, topological operations and visualisation. In addition xBIM supports 
bi-directional translation between IFC and COBie formats.

XbimWebUI is a Javascript library which can be used for web presentation of BIM models. It uses WebGL and is independent of any third party WebGL framework. We did use SceneJS and other frameworks in past but this is independent of any of them. The viewer takes WexBIM data format as its input. This is our custom binary data format which can be [produced using core xBIM Libraries](http://docs.xbim.net/examples/creating-wexbim-file.html). Detailed documentation is available [**here**](http://docs.xbim.net/XbimWebUI/).

## Getting Started

You will need Visual Studio 2010 SP1 or newer to compile the Solution. All solutions target .NET 4.0. The 4.0 Client profile
may be supported for some projects.

Xbim is a software library, and is currently deployed with a number of sample applications to demonstrate its capabilities.

Please note: all the samples in this solution are examples of how to use the Xbim library, and not intended to be used in a 
production environment without further development.

## Licence

The XBIM library is made available under the CDDL Open Source licence.  See the licences folder for a full text.

All licences should support the commercial usage of the XBIM system within a 'Larger Work', as long as you honour 
the licence agreements.
